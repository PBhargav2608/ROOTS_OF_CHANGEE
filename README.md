The project addresses several key problems faced by farmers â€“ Lack of Agricultural Knowledge, Limited Awareness of Government Support, Market Uncertainty, Crop selection Challenges.
The main goal of the project is to provide necessary information on agriculture for farmers who may not be aware of various types of diseases and the necessary pesticides for treatment. Additionally, it aims to support farmers who are unfamiliar with the government schemes available to assist them. Furthermore, it assists farmers who want to sell their crop production but are unsure of the best market with profitable prices. The project also aims to raise awareness among farmers who are unfamiliar with growing suitable crops in different seasons or localities based on their soil type. Moreover, it provides information about animals and their habitats.
